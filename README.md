# SteamPlaytimeFarm
### A lightweight tool to farm playtime on Steam games

SteamPlaytimeFarm (SPF) allows you to farm playtime in steam games which can allow you to obtain trading cards quickly!
<br>
Requires you to have your steam client open and be logged in.
<br>
You may only idle games you have purchased and that are in your Steam library.

## How it works
SteamPlaytimeFarm works by creating processes that trick your steam client into thinking it is running a specific game.
<br>
This means that to steam the fake games are indistinguishable from the real games.
