# SteamPlaytimeFarm
### A lightweight tool to farm playtime on Steam games

SteamPlaytimeFarm (SPF) allows you to farm playtime in steam games which can allow you to obtain trading cards quickly!
Requires you to have your steam client open and be logged in.
You may only idle games you have purchased and that are in your Steam library.

## How it works
SteamPlaytimeFarm works by creating processes that trick your steam client into thinking it is running a specific game.
This means that to steam the fake games are indistinguishable from the real games.

#### Any issues or bans (while unlikely) are YOUR responsibility!!
